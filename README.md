### Data Structures and algorithms

This repository contains implmentation of basic data structures in Python and also some examples of their implementation.

The code in this repo was written primarily during the YouTube series **Implementation of Data Structures in Python** on channel [Bikalpa Codes](bit.ly/bikalpa-codes). If you want to know how this works, you may want to go through the series.

Also, if you are from the event and looking for the persentation slides, you can download it frorm [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M7G_O7w3GZo6GYZQ_N95aSK_QMQPzflM?usp=sharing).
